# Superhero Gallery

A superhero gallery that displays a new hero with each button click, infinitely cycling forever.

## Using only jQuery:

- When the page opens, show only the first character in the list. 
- Set the h1.name to the text for the first superher
- Setup a listener on the button.next
- Keep track of which one is visible so you know which is next
- Show the next element on each click of "next"
- Update the h1.name for each new hero
- When you hit the :last-child then click "next", go back to the :first-child
- Try animating the name to fade out and slide upwards on each click
- Now that you're able to go forward, try to make it go the other way (prev)
	- Spend the rest of your time trying to refine this and make it more efficient# hero
